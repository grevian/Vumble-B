Building Mumble and Murmur
==========================

To build mumble and murmur, type
qmake main.pro
make release

You may need to edit src/mumble/mumble.pro to reflect the installation paths you
use for libraries.
After building, the binaries will be in the release/ directory.

The qmake step supports a number of configurations options. To enable an
option, simply add CONFIG+=<option> to the end. If you want to change these
after your initial setup, you'll also need to pass -recursive.
So, to build without the server and without ASIO, the above line would be

qmake main.pro CONFIG+=no-server CONFIG+=no-asio -recursive

CONFIG+=no-client
 Don't build the client (Mumble)

CONFIG+=no-server
 Don't build the server (Murmur)

CONFIG+=no-bundled-celt (Mumble)
 Don't use the included version of CELT, but look for one on the system.
 Note that this requires that you have CELT 0.7.0 or 0.7.1 installed on
 your system as CELT does not maintain bitstream compatibility.

CONFIG+=no-bundled-speex (Mumble)
 Don't use the included version of Speex, but look for one on the system.
 Note that this requires your system-installed Speex to be at least version
 1.2.0.

CONFIG+=optimize
 Build a heavily optimized version, specific to the machine it's being
 compiled on.

CONFIG+=no-crash-report (Mumble)
 Don't include support for reporting crashes to the Mumble developers.

CONFIG+=universal (OSX)
 Build a universal binary build of Mumble for i386 and ppc instead of the
 default x86-64-only build. The universal build is meant to be used with
 the Carbon version of Qt, and is compatible with 10.4+.
 The x86-64 build of Mumble is compatible with 10.5+ and requires a Cocoa
 version of Qt.

CONFIG+=no-dbus (Mumble)
 Don't include DBus support on Mumble. This has no effect on Murmur, which
 requires DBus to work.

CONFIG+=no-g15 (Mumble)
 Don't include support for the G15 keyboard (and compatible devices).

CONFIG+=no-asio (Mumble, Win32)
 Don't build support for ASIO audio input.

CONFIG+=no-directsound (Mumble, Win32)
 Don't build support for DirectSound.

CONFIG+=no-wasapi (Mumble, Win32)
 Don't build support for WASAPI.

CONFIG+=no-portaudio (Mumble, Unix, OSX)
 Don't build support for PortAudio.

CONFIG+=no-pulseaudio (Mumble, Unix)
 Don't build support for PulseAudio.

CONFIG+=no-oss (Mumble, Linux)
 Don't build support for OSS. Mumble supports OSS4 if you have the correct
 header files.

CONFIG+=no-alsa (Mumble, Linux)
 Don't build support for ALSA.

CONFIG+=no-speechd (Mumble, Linux)
 Don't build support for Speech Dispatcher.

CONFIG+=no-update (Mumble)
 Default disable the checking of new versions. (For distributions)

CONFIG+=no-embed-qt-translations (Mumble)
 Don't embed the translations for Qt, load them from the system. (For
 distributions).

CONFIG+=no-ice (Murmur)
 Don't build support for Ice RPC.
 
CONFIG+=no-bonjour
 Don't build support for Bonjour.

CONFIG+=no-overlay (Mumble, Linux)
 Don't build the overlay library.

User Registrations
==================

To enable user registration, copy scripts/murmur.pl to murmur.cgi and put it
somewhere accessible by your webserver. Make sure your webserver is
configured to execute it as a CGI, and make sure you edit it to reflect
the configuration parameters. Note that the user the CGI will run as needs
write permissions to both the database file and the directory the database
file resides in.
